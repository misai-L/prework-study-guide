# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description

The motivation behind this webpage was to experience first hand what software development might look like. 
The experience of having built the webpage from the ground up was by far a satisfying experience. I persoanlly built this project mainly for my own educational purposes. 
The webpage won't really solve much of a new comers problems, it's still too premature. Although, it does give hope to whats possible in future progress and understanding of coding for someone that is completely new to the coding community.
I personally learned that a webpage is not just made up of a single page of unrecognizable group of characters, it's far more complex than i had initially imagined. Even though I struggled myself to understand everything, the process is comprehensible with the proper direction.
